Objective
The goal of this assignment is to design and implement a knowledge-based chatbot that responds to user queries. The chatbot will focus on a specific topic, which can be chosen by your group (e.g., sports history, tech innovations, or university-related FAQs).

Assignment Overview
Create a chatbot that:

Accepts user input through a web interface.
Responds intelligently based on a predefined set of knowledge (database or hardcoded).
Provides a user-friendly interface for interaction.
1. Topic Selection
Choose a specific topic for your chatbot (e.g., Pittsburgh sports history, programming languages, movie trivia, etc.).
Your chatbot should handle at least 10 unique questions and responses.
2. Backend Development
Use a programming language of your choice (e.g., PHP).
Store questions and answers in a database (e.g., PostgreSQL) 
Implement logic to match user input to predefined responses. Use case-insensitive matching and provide a fallback response for unknown queries (e.g., "I’m sorry, I don’t know the answer to that.").

A description of your chatbot.
The technology stack you used (e.g., PHP with PostgreSQL, JavaScript).
A list of predefined questions and answers.
